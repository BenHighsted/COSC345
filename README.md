We are creating a game called 'Dungeon Game' (name to be changed) programmed in C, using the SDL2 library (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

We created our file in Xcode, so to build and run our program you will need to use the XCode project file and then download a couple SDL Library files and place them in specific locations on your PC. These instructions are currently only valid for MACOS operating systems.

First, you will need to download SDL 2.0 from here https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php. Then you will need to place the frame work into your /Library/Frameworks folder (use command + shift + g on finder and use it to search for and find the folder).

Next, you will need to download SDL_TTF from https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/. Then you will need to place that frame work in your frameworks folder also.

Lastly, you will need to use homebrew to install sdl2_image onto your machine. To install homebrew, simply type /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" into your MACOS terminal, and it will install. Once its installed or if you already have it, type 'brew install sdl2_image'. This will install sdl2 image into the correct directory and after doing this your librarys will all be setup to build and run our game.

In the ZIP folder you download will be a code blocks project which, if you set up the librarys correctly, will have no issues to build and run. Also will be contained another folder, which will have an executable and some images, which if you double click to run (and allow it in system preferences -> security and privacy) and it will run our program outside of Xcode.

MIGHT NEED TO ADD IMAGES TO EXECUTABLE LOCATION
