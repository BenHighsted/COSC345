We are creating a game called 'Fall Game' (name to be changed) programmed in C, using the SDL2 library (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

This is where we will need to add instructions for andrew to compile and run our program, including how to set up the libary file. (DELETE THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMISSION).

We created our file in Xcode, so to build and run our program you will need to use the XCode project file and then download a couple SDL Library files and place them in specific locations on your PC. These instructions are currently only valid for MACOS operating systems.

First, you will need to download SDL 2.0 from here https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php. Then you will need to place the frame work ... and so on.
