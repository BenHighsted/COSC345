COSC345 Group Project Otago University 2019.

We are creating a game called 'Dungeon Fall' programmed in C, using the SDL2 library (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

For the Final release, there is no setup required if you simply want to run the game outside of xcode. Download the DungeonFall folder, and double click the 'Dungeon Fall' icon to run.

If you wish to run our game through Xcode, there is a little bit of setup required (which is simply just moving folders to the correct locations).

To run it through Xcode, download the DeveloperDungeonFall folder, and open up the project in Xcode. BEFORE you do any of the following steps, you must first build the program, so that the executable location exists. To do this, simply go Product->Build and it will build the project.

In Xcode on the left side of the screen, there is the products folder containing the executable. Right click on the executable (Called 'Assignment') and click on 'Show in finder'. This is where you need to copy the 'content' folder from the documents provided in the download. 
While in the finder window, right click at the top of the finder window which states the name (which will be debug), and go to the directory behind it called 'Products'. This is where you need to copy the 'Frameworks' folder in the provided documents.
After these two steps, you are now ready to run the program in Xcode.
